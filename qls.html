<p>The Quarry Lane School was founded in 1991 by Dr. Sabri Arac as an infant/toddler preschool and was expanded into an elementary school at its original Pleasanton, California campus. In 2000, Dr. Arac opened a campus in Dublin, California to accommodate the elementary school that was rapidly growing. The Pleasanton campus was open only to preschool students, while elementary students studied at the Dublin campus. In 2004, Dr. Arac opened the second Pleasanton preschool campus, the Pleasanton West campus. In 2005, the Dublin Campus expanded to include an Upper School program, consisting of a middle school and high school, with its first graduating class being in 2010.<br><br>
